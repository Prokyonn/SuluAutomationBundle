The SuluAutomationBundle provides a way to manages future tasks which can be scheduled for entities in the Sulu-Admin.
For example schedule the publishing of a page to a specific datetime in the future.

To schedule tasks this bundle uses the [php-task library](https://github.com/php-task/php-task).
